# Misc-source-codes

1. Naive bayes clasiffier script, pulls data from numpy dataset A,B and test and gives the result (python)
2. Pose estimation script (python)
Note: The OpenCV Haar cascade classifier xmls and Facemark's LBF modes yaml should point to your OpenCV library installation dir. 
When I ran this script on my Manjaro distro, was having issues, hence I copied them to the local script run dir. 
3. Program that reads float values from a textfile and writes them to a new file using pthreads (c/c++)
