# Misc-codes

1. Naive bayes clasiffier script, pulls data from numpy dataset A,B and test and gives the result (python)
2. Pose estimation script (python)
Note: The OpenCV Haar cascade classifier .xmls and Facemark model .yaml should point to default OpenCV library installation dir. 
When I ran this script on my Manjaro distro, was having issues, hence I copied them to the local script run dir. 
Images are from Chokepoint dataset, credits here http://arma.sourceforge.net/chokepoint/
3. Program that reads float values from a text file and writes them to a new text file using pthread (c/c++)
